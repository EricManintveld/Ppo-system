# PPO-System
Prescriptive process optimization system developped for my master thesis: "Prescriptive Process Optimization Using Large
Language Models: A Preliminary Investigation"

The system uses the Split Miner (1) and Alarm System (2) in combination with ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo to generate timely and actionable recommendations in a process mining context.
